# Arduino-as-ISP-modded-LED-pins
Copy of the Arduino ISP sketch with changed PINs to fit PCB with RGB-LED

Changed the Pins for Programm Led, Heartbeat LED and Error LED to fit the RGB-LED on the designed PCB
LED_Test.ino is used to check the LEDs on the PCB, each LED blinks once, twice or three times. Defines in LED_Test are consistent with ArduinoISP_modPin
